### Determinants of Amsterdam House Prices
Project repository: https://github.com/Mahdiazhari/Code-capstone 
Data was obtained from NVM (Dutch Real Estate Agent Organization). Through Hedonic Regression, it is found that some house features have a negative linear relation with predicted house price, and apartments in Amsterdam costs more than the other house types in Amsterdam. A neural network regression model was tested against the baseline linear regression model and obtained 10% more accuracy.
