## Projects

### Determinants of Amsterdam House Prices
#### Project repository: https://github.com/Mahdiazhari/Code-capstone 
Data was obtained from NVM (Dutch Real Estate Agent Organization). Through Hedonic Regression, it is found that some house features have a negative linear relation with predicted house price, and apartments in Amsterdam costs more than the other house types in Amsterdam. A neural network regression model was tested against the baseline linear regression model and obtained 10% more accuracy.

### Machine Learning Course UvA 2017/2018
This is a collection of related projects done during the course of University of Amsterdam's 2017/2018 Machine Learning campus course.
#### Project repository: https://github.com/Mahdiazhari/Machine-Learning
#### Graded Assignments
  1. Manual Implementation of Logistic Regression. Model is trained and tested on MNIST dataset.
  2. Evaluation and comparation of the parametric Logistic Regression and non-parametric K-NN algorithm to classify MNIST dataset. K-NN is better at predicting on this dataset, with a higher accuracy score of 0.93. Moreover, higher precision, recall, and F-scores were also obtained using this method instead of Logistic Regression. 
  
#### Final Project: Wine Quality Classification 
#### Project repository: https://github.com/Mahdiazhari/wine-stuff
This project is done as part of the final project for the UvA Machine Learning course. Using a kaggle wine dataset, my team and I compared the performances of three classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. We found that for this specific problem, our Random Forest classifier performed the best out of the three.


### Salary Prediction
#### Project repository: https://github.com/Mahdiazhari/salary-prediction-project
In this project, I created a prediction model for employee salaries in the USA based on job characteristics. The aim of this project was to find out how these features impact salaries of various jobs. I created and compared several regression models. My best model performed much better than the baseline linear regression model with an average MSE of 357.
